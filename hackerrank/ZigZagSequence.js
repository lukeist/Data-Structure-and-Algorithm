// In this challenge, the task is to debug the existing code to successfully execute all provided test files.

// Given an array of  distinct integers, transform the array into a zig zag sequence by permuting the array elements. A sequence will be called a zig zag sequence if the first  elements in the sequence are in increasing order and the last  elements are in decreasing order, where . You need to find the lexicographically smallest zig zag sequence of the given array.

// Example.

// Now if we permute the array as , the result is a zig zag sequence.

// Debug the given function findZigZagSequence to return the appropriate zig zag sequence for the given input array.

// Note: You can modify at most three lines in the given code. You cannot add or remove lines of code.

// To restore the original code, click on the icon to the right of the language selector.

// Input Format

// The first line contains  the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer , denoting the number of array elements. The next line of the test case contains  elements of array .

// Constraints

//  ( is always odd)

// Output Format

// For each test cases, print the elements of the transformed zig zag sequence in a single line.
